# JJT-Balatro-Ideas
A general list of JJT references in the form of a Balatro Joker. 

This is also where I will put either overpowered jokers or consumables that end your run. 


Jokers
------
Pointer
>This will give a Pointer (consumable) once sold and can be duped.


Hand
>Contrary to how hands work, this grants the ability to manipulate the game's code. Cannot be used to unlock any cards that bypass Unlock All.


The World Revolving
>Once upon a time, there was a duo. A duo so revered that nobody could withstand their power.
>
>Gives ^^5 mult, increase by ^^^^^1 if counterpart is acquired, duplicates itself after a showdown boss blind is defeated.


The Moon Is Shattered
>This is the counterpart for TWR, the one who achieved immortality and solidified their position.
>
>Gives ^^^^^5 mult, increase by {1} if TWR is in jokers during run. Duplicates itself if TWR duplicates.


Annoyance [Common] 
>Gives +8 mult, decrease by 1 every round. Cannot be sold after buying.


Grief [Common] 
>Gives +16 mult, decrease by half every round. Can be combined.


Treason [Common] 
>Gives 256 chips, decrease by 1/3 every round. Can be combined.


Limbo [Common] 
>Gives 2x mult, decrease by 0.01 for every hand played. Can be combined.


Delirium [Common] 
>Gives 40 mult, increase by 20 for every Legendary Joker during run. 


Emotion [IT TRANSCENDS ALL] 
>The combination of Limbo, Treason and Grief. Costs 1e+150 if in Balanced Deck/Sleeve, also costs 1e+150 if trying to get in a real run.
>
>Gives ee4####937#94##20 mult, increase by M(9) for every other joker in run.
>
>M(9) stands for Bashicu Matrix System Levels, OmegaNum can't handle anything above M(8) so this is a new territory of its own.
>
>ALL jokers now give e4##10000 mult regardless if it originally gave Xmult, Emult, EEmult, EEEmult or Xchips, Chips, Echips and EEchips. However, all probabilities stay the same.
>
>"You won, but at what cost? You can endlessly win, but you can't lose now. Have a trophy of shame."
>
>Gives an achievement "Transcend all common sense."
>
>Requirements for said achievement: Combine Grief, Limbo and Treason all in one round, if you attempt to combine them with less than their original stats, your run automatically loses.


KLJY [IT TRANSCENDS ALL] 
>Similar to Emotion, this is one of the jokers that can be acquired through joker combination.
>
>The method to get this is basically by duplicating Emotion 256 times and combining all of them at the same time.
>
>Gives F_lim(BMS)+w^e2##9 mult, increase by F_lim(BMS)+w^^^w for every joker combination.
>
>"It's gotten real ridiculous now, hasn't it? You did this yourself, now you can't go back."
>
>Upon acquiring, ante is automatically raised to Ante 1.7e308 and cannot be reverted by any Ante-Resetting Vouchers.
>
>I have plans for a Trilogy too, just hope that I don't forget about it.


John [Uncommon] 
>Gives x1.5 mult for every common joker.


Dave [Uncommon] 
>Gives x1.5 mult for every consumable that's been used.
